Introduction
In the previous chapter a Web App was created from scratch. Although the content of this chapter is relatively independent of the previous one, I recommend complete it first. This chapter consists of several parts. Remember that you can make suggestions to the course in the mailing list or the Telegram group.

The final goal of the chapter is to create a fully functional calculator. Initially, it will be a very basic application but it will progressively improve.
