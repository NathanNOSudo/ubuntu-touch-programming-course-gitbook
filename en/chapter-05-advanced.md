# Introduction

In the course, the concepts are introduced little by little to make them easier to understand. Although this rhythm of explanation is comfortable to follow, it obliges me to delay the advanced concepts.

To avoid this problem, I've created a new block with advanced topics. In the first chapter, a collaboration of Fulvio Russo, you will see an application that allows you to record the time of a city. The data is stored in an SQLite database and all the steps for entering, updating, searching or deleting the information are studied in the chapter. The application also saves user preferences easily using the Setting object.
