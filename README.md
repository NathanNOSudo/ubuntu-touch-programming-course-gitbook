# Ubuntu Touch Programming course (MarkDown code)
The [Ubuntu Touch Programming course](https://www.gitbook.com/book/mimecar/ubuntu-touch-programming-course) uses GitBook to generate documentation in PDF, ePub and Mobi (Kindle) formats. The source code that generates the documentation uses MarkDown and I had it in a private repository.

I have decided to make public the source code that generates the documentation for several reasons:
* Allows other users to collaborate with the course. This is important in course translations to other languages. At the moment the course is published in Spanish and English.
* The source code serves as an example for the articles I'm going to write in [InnerZaurus](https://www.innerzaurus.com/) about GitBook and MarkDown.
* Course resources are integrated into two sites (GitHub and GitBook).
